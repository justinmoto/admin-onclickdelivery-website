1. Programming Paradigms
    - Prefer functional programming over object-oriented programming.
    - Use declarative programming when it reduces code complexity and improves readability.
    - Apply object-oriented design selectively, only when it improves maintainability, readability, and reduces complexity.

2. File and Content Management
    - On code changes, review and update the entire file where modifications occur, not just the changed lines.
    - Maintain a code content outline and a call graph at the top of each file. Update these artifacts on every significant code change.

3. Coding Standards
    - All functions must have:
        - Type hints for all parameters and return types.
        - Doc-strings describing purpose, parameters, and return values.
        - Unit tests validating functionality.

4. Code Writing Discipline
    - Refrain from code auto-completion in functions or sections where insufficient comments, type hints, or contextual code exist.
